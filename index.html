        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Hello! Iâ€™m Jiashu Han, a PhD student studying physics at UC San Diego with a focus on theoretical and observational cosmology. My research involves making connections between theoretical models and observational signatures in data through statistical inference and numerical methods. My passion lies in leveraging data to drive insights, and I hope to find opportunities that will allow me to use my skills to help make informed decisions that will enhance our ability to understand the world.</p>

        <!-- <p>I was born and raised in Wuhan, China. I have been studying in the U.S. since 2011. During the past eight years, I lived in Alabama, Minnesota, and California. Outside of physics, I like to explore nature and capture the interesting moments with my camera. </p> -->
