        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Hello! I’m Jiashu Han, a PhD student in Physics at the University of California, San Diego, specializing in theoretical and observational cosmology. My research focuses on bridging theoretical models with observational data using statistical inference and numerical methods. Alongside my research, I bring over five years of experience teaching and supporting undergraduate physics courses in a range of instructional roles, with a strong interest in course design and evidence-based, student-centered pedagogy. I am deeply committed to fostering inclusive learning environments and helping students develop critical thinking, problem-solving, and quantitative reasoning skills that extend beyond the classroom.</p>

        <!-- <p>I was born and raised in Wuhan, China. I have been studying in the U.S. since 2011. During the past eight years, I lived in Alabama, Minnesota, and California. Outside of physics, I like to explore nature and capture the interesting moments with my camera. </p> -->
