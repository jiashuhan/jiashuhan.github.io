            Here are some personal projects I worked on outside of work. Find more on my <a href="https://github.com/jiashuhan">Github page</a>.

        <h3>N-body Newtonian gravity simulation</h3>

        <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/jiashuhan/planets">This</a> is a user-friendly n-body simulation that allows you to customize the celestial objects in a planetary (or just random) system. It supports a range of different numerical integration methods depending on what kind of accuracy you want to achieve. It's very fun to play with!

            This simulation code originated from an undergraduate course project but grew larger over the years. I mostly use it to verify the planetary motions in the video game Kerbal Space Program (I'm a huge fan).
